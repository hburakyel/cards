# Cards

**Cards** is an experimental curatorial project with pop-up exhibitions in unexpected urban spaces ‚Äî such as traffic signs, park benches, and building forecourts.  

Each ‚ÄúCard‚Äù exhibition begins with an invitation for a visual artist to create a short-lived intervention outside traditional art institutions. The goal is to make contemporary art accessible to different audiences, encouraging unconventional interactions and transforming public perceptions of art.

Since its inception in **May 2022** with *Sebasti√°n Garbrecht*, the project has featured remarkable collaborations with artists such as:

- Alina Perkins  
- Clyde Conwell  
- Maximiliano Si√±ani  
- Blaykyi Kenyah  
- Tomas Maglione  
- Mia Superstar  
- Felipe Alvarez Parisi  
- Commune 6x3  
- Jack Brennan  
- Sopo Kashakashvili  
- Lisa Gutscher  
- Nina Nadig  
- Ga≈°per Kun≈°iƒç  
- Rahel Goetsch  
- Yuxiu Xiong  
- Tong Yang  
- Hemansingh Lutchmun  
- Barbi Latina
