Cards

*Cards* is an experimental, itinerant art project curated by Andrés Gorzycki. It transforms public spaces into sites of urban ritual through fleeting, one-day exhibitions. Since 2022, the project has collaborated with 27 artists across Berlin, Buenos Aires, Frankfurt, Prague, and Stockholm.

This repository serves as the project’s comprehensive digital archive and spatial index. The goal was to build a high-flexibility, zero-cost publishing workflow that rejects heavy institutional backends in favor of accessible, non-specialized tools.

Logic: A custom digital platform designed to archive transient, ephemeral art events.

Architecture: Repurposes Google Sheets as a lightweight, collaborative CMS and Mapbox as a spatial index for urban interventions.

Infrastructure: Hosted entirely on GitHub Pages, ensuring the project remains permanent and cost-efficient without the need for paid server maintenance.

Visual Identity: The UI mirrors the "trading-card" ethos conceptualized by the curators (inspired by Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh!), turning digital documentation into collectible artifacts.

Philosophy: Grounded in Sara Ahmed’s Queer Phenomenology, using mundane objects (Streetlights, Stones, Rope) to reorient marginalized artistic gestures from the periphery to the center.
