Cards

Cards is an experimental curatorial project with pop-up exhibitions in unexpected urban spaces curated by Andrés Gorzycki. Each “Card” exhibition begins with an invitation for a visual artist to create a short-lived intervention outside traditional art institutions. The goal is to make contemporary art accessible to different audiences, encouraging unconventional interactions and transforming public perceptions of art. This digital platform serves as a comprehensive repository for documentation, locations, and archives of each *Cards* edition.
